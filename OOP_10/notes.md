OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects
We use objects to model (describe) real world or abstract features
Objects contain data (properties) and code (methods)
Class is a blueprint used to create new objects based on the rules defined in the class

FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF OOP

1. ABSTRACTION
2. ENCAPSULATION
3. INHERITANCE
4. POLYMORPHISM

PROTOTYPES
All obj in JS are linked to a prototype object. Prototype objects contain methods and properties that all the objects linked to that prototype can access and use. This is known as prototypal inheritance, an instance inheriting from a class.

3 WAYS TO IMPLEMENT PROTOTYPAL INHERITANCE IN JS

1. Constructor functions
2. ES6 classes
3. object.create()
